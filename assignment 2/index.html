        <h2>Verse 1</h2>
        <p>You're insecure, don't know what for<br>
            You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door<br>
            Don't need makeup to cover up (Huh)<br>
            Bein' the way that you are is enough<br>

        <h4>Chorus</h4>
        <p>Baby, you light up my world like nobody else<br>
            The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
            But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell<br>
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful<br>
            If only you saw what I can see<br>
            You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
            You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
            You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh<br>

        <p>So c-come on, you got it wrong<br>
            To prove I'm right, I put it in a song<br>
            I don't know why you're being shy<br>
            I don't know why you're being shy<br>
